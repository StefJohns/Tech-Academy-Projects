    <h1>Learning Visual Studio</h1>
    <p>In this lesson we learned how to connect to GitHub in order to push files. We also learned about Team Foundation Services, however, most of the videos for this section are 3 years old, so additional research is required for updated versions of the programs being learned.</p>
